::: {#intro-heading}
Hi there! My name is Talia and I use she/her pronouns. 

I specialize in working with teams to identify actionable business insights in high-impact market opportunities by applying data science and data analytics. I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Psychology from Macalester College in May 2024. While at Macalester, was 4-year member and 2-time captain of varsity women's tennis team.
